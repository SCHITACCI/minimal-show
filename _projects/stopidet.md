IDET is&nbsp;a protest against arms fair held in Brno from May 31st to June 2nd&nbsp;2017. Take a&nbsp;look at stopidet.cz for more information. You can take a photo on a selfie app, read a&nbsp;statement and write down a&nbsp;petition. Make your own opinion and identify yourself. We are convinced that war starts here.
